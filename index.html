<h1>goxtool.py</h1>

<p>goxtool.py is a trading client for the MtGox Bitcoin currency exchange. It
allows you to watch live market data, to send or cancel orders or to run a
fully automated trading bot. It is designed to work in the Linux console and it
also natively works on Mac OS-X (<a name="Windows" id="Windows"
href="cygwin.html">Windows users see here</a>), its written in Python and is
using the (n)curses library to draw its user interface (it does <span
style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> have a GTK or Qt interface), all it needs
to run is a terminal (either locally or remote through ssh or putty). <br />

When goxtool is running it looks like this:<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span> </p>

<h2>How to install </h2>

<p>Open a terminal in an empty folder or in the folder you usually use to clone
repositories and clone the master branch:<br />
</p>
<pre>git clone git://github.com/prof7bit/goxtool.git</pre>

<p>This will create a folder named <span class="codeword">goxtool</span>
containing all the needed files. Thats all, now it is installed and ready to
use. You can now already watch live market data (without any trading functions
being enabled), you can later add a MtGox API-key to it to have full access to
your account but for now just proceed to the next step, start it without an
account, just to make sure everything works.</p>

<h2>How to start it </h2>

<p>change into to the <span class="codeword">goxtool</span> folder that was
created in the previous step and start goxtool.py:<br />
</p>
<pre>cd goxtool
 ./goxtool.py</pre>

<p>Keyboard commands (only the ones useful in view-only mode, without Mt.Gox
account):</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="keycmd">q</span> quit</li>
  <li><span class="keycmd">l</span> (lower case "L") reload the strategy module
    (see advanced usage)</li>
  <li><span class="keycmd">D</span> (shift + d) switch to depth chart view</li>
  <li><span class="keycmd">H</span> (shift + h) switch to candlestick history
    chart view</li>
  <li><span class="keycmd">S</span> (shift + s) toggle summing up the volume of
    order book levels  on/off</li>
  <li><span class="keycmd">T</span> (shift + t) toggle summing up the volume in
    the depth chart on/off</li>
  <li><span class="keycmd">-</span> order book zoom out (increase group
  size)</li>
  <li><span class="keycmd">+</span> order book zoom in (decrease group
  size)</li>
  <li><span class="keycmd">,</span> depth chart zoom out (increase group
  size)</li>
  <li><span class="keycmd">.</span> depth chart zoom in (decrease group
  size)</li>
</ul>

<p>(There will be even more commands once you connect it to your Mt.Gox
account)</p>

<p>There is also a <span class="codeword">goxtool.ini</span> file, it will be
created on the first start. In the <span class="codeword">.ini</span> file
there are some parameters you can change, for example the currency you want to
trade BTC against or some parameters regarding the network protocol. Some of
the <span class="codeword">.ini</span> settings can be overridden by command
line options (use the <span class="codeword">--help</span> option to see a
list). The default protocol is <span class="codeword">websocket</span>, the
alternative would be <span class="codeword">socketio</span> (and also recently
added <span class="codeword">pubnub</span>), goxtool implements all three
protocols, the websocket server is currently more reliable. There is also an
option to use the http API for trading commands instead sending them over the
stream connection.</p>

<h3>socketio, websocket or pubnub? Which one is worse?</h3>

<p>The three options are <span class="codeword">socketio,</span> <span
class="codeword">websocket</span> or <span class="codeword">pubnub</span>, the
.ini setting for this is <span class="codeword">use_plain_old_websocket</span>
to select between socketio or websocket, there is not yet an ini setting for
pubnub, this will change in the near future. The protocol can also be forced on
the command line and will take precedence over whatever is set in the ini.</p>

<p>To force it connecting with socketio:<br />
</p>
<pre>./goxtool.py --protocol=socketio</pre>

<p> To force it connecting to the websocket server:<br />
</p>
<pre>./goxtool.py --protocol=websocket</pre>

<p> To force it connecting to the pubnub server:<br />
</p>
<pre>./goxtool.py --protocol=pubnub</pre>

<p>It has turned out that websocket is currently the most reliable protocol,
although the recently added new pubnub protocol might eventually take its place
(it still has some problems occasionally, pubnub is conceptually inferior to
websocket and producing twice as much network load and the MtGox pubnub also
does not allow sending trading commands over the stream connection, so using
pubnub will also automatically enable the http API for trading commands)<br />
<br />
If you experience a high lag between sending an order and the ack (the
op:result) not appearing immediately which is happening during times of really
high volume (only websocket and socketio are affected) or mysteriously lost
(ignored) trading commands then you should consider also adding <span
class="codeword">--use-http</span> to make it send trading commands via http.
Http makes it slightly slower to execute many trades in a row but has been much
more reliable when mtgox was under heavy load or ddos or similar. If you don't
need to send many orders very fast then this option won't hurt. <span
class="codeword">--use-http</span> can be combined with either <span
class="codeword">socketio</span> or <span class="codeword">websocket</span>.
It is always automatically activated when using <span
class="codeword">pubnub</span>. You can also make it the default in the ini
file.<br />
<br />
This is what I am currently using and I recommend it: </p>
<pre>./goxtool.py --protocol=websocket --use-http</pre>

<p>When websocket is down due to ddos then I recommend the following: </p>
<pre>./goxtool.py --protocol=pubnub</pre>

<h2>How to connect it to your MtGox account</h2>

<p>Do the following:</p>
<pre>./goxtool.py --add-secret</pre>

<p>This will now ask you for key, secret and password. Key and secret belong to
a shared secret that is created by MtGox to authenticate your trading software
against their API. You can request as many keys from MtGox as you need, every
application you connect to your MtGox account should have its own key, you can
also at any time delete the keys again that you no longer need.<br />
<br />
Now you need a Key/Secret pair for goxtool. Open your web browser, log in to
your MtGox account, click on "Security Center", click on "Advanced API Key
Creation", choose a name for your key (every key will have a name so you can
later easily tell them apart), make sure you check at least the boxes "Get
Info" and "Trade" (this is what the application will be allowed to do with this
key) and then finally click on "Create Key".<br />
<br />
Now MtGox will create 2 strings of cryptic numbers and letters, the "API-Key"
and the "Secret". Now copy&amp;paste the API-Key into the terminal where it
asked you for "Key", press enter, now it will ask you for "Secret",
copy&amp;paste the Secret into the terminal, press enter and now it will ask
you for a passphrase. It is important to understand what is going on here. The
Key/Secret from above must under no circumstances ever come into the wrong
hands, therefore goxtool won't just store them in the <span
class="codeword">.ini</span> file, goxtool will encrypt it and thats what the
passphrase is needed for. Choose a secure passphrase (it will ask you twice to
make sure there is no typo), you will also not see anything in the console (not
even "*") while typing, this is not a bug, this is intentional. Choose a strong
passphrase, type it into the terminal, press enter, repeat the passphrase,
press enter again and now it will tell you that it has been encrypted and saved
to the .ini file and exit.<br />
<br />
Now start goxtool again:<br />
</p>
<pre>./goxtool.py
enter passphrase for secret: </pre>

<p>From now on every time you start goxtool it will ask you for the passphrase
in order to be able to decrypt and use the secret. Enter your passphrase, press
enter. Now goxtool will start and you will notice that now it is showing your
account balance at the top of the window. Now all trading functions are
enabled.<br />
<br />
Keyboard commands for trading:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="keycmd">F4</span> : New buy order</li>
  <li><span class="keycmd">F5</span> : New sell order</li>
  <li><span class="keycmd">F6</span> : View orders / cancel order(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the cancel dialog you can move up/down with the arrow keys, use <span
class="keycmd">INS</span> to select/unselect orders (you can select multiple
orders and cancel them all at once) or if you just quickly want to cancel only
one order just highlight to the order and hit <span class="keycmd">F8</span>.
It behaves a little bit like deleting files in midnight commander.<br />
<br />
When entering a new order you can move between the fields with up/down keys or
move to the next field with <span class="keycmd">tab</span> or <span
class="keycmd">enter</span> (but only if you entered a valid number into the
previous field, decimal separator is . (not comma, even on European computers),
send the order with <span class="keycmd">enter</span>. <br />
<br />
All dialogs can be closed with <span class="keycmd">F10</span> or <span
class="keycmd">ESC</span>.</p>

<h2>Strategy module, strategy.py</h2>

<p>You can write your own trading bots. There is a file named strategy.py, it
contains a class <span class="codeword">Strategy()</span> which constitutes a
trading bot that by default does nothing (its an empty skeleton). It has event
methods (slots) connected to signals that will be fired when certain events
occur. From within these methods you can then do arbitrary stuff (peek around
in <span class="codeword">gox.orderbook</span> to see where bids and asks are
located, call <span class="codeword">gox.buy()</span>, <span
class="codeword">gox.sell()</span>  or <span
class="codeword">gox.cancel()</span> methods to build a fully automated trading
bot or you can use the key press slot (it will be called on all letter keys
except <span class="keycmd">l</span> and <span class="keycmd">q</span>) to
build a semi-automatic bot that reacts to key presses or to influence
parameters of your bot or anything else you can imagine. Examples of simple
bots will soon follow.<br />
<br />
If you decide to make serious use of this then please create a new python file
for your strategy. either make a copy of the default <span
class="codeword">strategy.py</span> skeleton or make a module that imports
strategy and has a class Strategy(strategy.Strategy), give this module file a
different name and leave <span class="codeword">strategy.py</span> alone so it
won't collide with upstream changes you pull from github. By default goxtool
will load <span class="codeword">strategy.py</span> but you can start it with
the <span class="codeword">--strategy</span> command line option to specify
your own strategy module or a comma separated list of many modules:</p>
<pre>./goxtool --strategy=mybot.py,myotherbot.py</pre>

<p>You can even edit the strategy while goxtool is running and then reload it
at runtime (this can be very useful), just press the <span
class="keycmd">l</span> key (lowercase L) and it will do the following
things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>emit signal _strategy_unload, this will call <span
    class="codeword">slot_before_unload()</span><br />
  </li>
  <li>free the currently running instance of <span
    class="codeword">Strategy()</span> (your <span
    class="codeword">__del__()</span> method <span
    style="font-weight: bold;">should</span> be called)</li>
  <li>re-import the changed module file</li>
  <li>create a new instance of <span class="codeword">Strategy()</span> and
    call your<span class="codeword">__init__()</span> again. </li>
</ul>

<p>You should persist the state of your bot (if needed) in <span
class="codeword">slot_before_unload()</span> and reload it in <span
class="codeword">__init__()</span>. Leave the <span
class="codeword">__del__()</span> method alone, its only there to print a log
message to debug proper unloading!<br />
<br />
Please make sure that you can see the debug output from the <span
class="codeword">__del__()</span> method in the log when the strategy is
reloading, you must be sure its able to free and garbage collect your strategy!
If you instantiate any circular references, even something as innocent as a
double linked list or even just an object holding a reference to the strategy
then this will effectively keep python from being able to garbage-collect it
and hold it in memory indefinitely (and keep sending it signals!). <br />
<br />
Use the <span class="codeword">slot_before_unload()</span> method to <span
class="codeword">del</span> everything in your strategy that might hold any
circular references. You can check that it works if you see the debug output 
of <span class="codeword">__del__()</span> in the log scrolling by when you
press <span class="keycmd">l</span> to reload it, the fact that <span
class="codeword">__del__()</span> was called is proof that it was properly
garbage-collected.<br />
<br />
Trading functions do NOT block, this means they also won't return the MtGox
order ID, you need to find your own way of remembering which orders you have
sent already. A few moments (seconds or minutes) after you have sent them they
will be acked by MtGox and it will fire <span
class="codeword">orderbook.signal_changed()</span><span
style="font-family: monospace;"></span>and when this happens you will find it
in the <span class="codeword">gox.orderbook.owns</span> list and it will have
an official order ID. I know this is not optimal (because this part of the code
is not yet complete, eventually there will be dedicated signals to notify your
bot about the results of trading commands) and also this document is not yet a
complete documentation. If you really want to dive into this: use the source,
Luke.</p>

<h2>How to keep it up to date</h2>

<p>Occasionally I will commit bugfixes, improvements, etc. To update your copy
of goxtool (assuming you previously installed it with git clone and not by just
downloading a zip file) do the following:</p>
<pre>git pull</pre>

<p>and if that complains because of local uncommitted changes because you
edited the strategy.py module or did other changes to the code then try
this:</p>
<pre>git stash
git pull
git stash pop</pre>

<p>Of course you could have also have followed my previous advise to not do
anything other than simple throw-away experiments in strategy.py so you can
always git reset --hard if everything else fails and use a separate file (and
probably even separate git branches) for serious bot development but this is
outside the scope of this document, there exist specialized howtos for git and
github elsewhere.<br />
